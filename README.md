# Designing-a-PDF-Audiobook
Audiobooks are proven to help students with reading disabilities become better readers and learners. They can be an integral asset to help appreciation, support certainty, save time on homework, and at last lead to better results. In this repository, the idea of converting PDF into an audiobook is implemented.
To convert this pdf into an audiobook, we make use of two of the most popular python libraries: pyttsx3 and PyPDF2. These two libraries can be installed using the pip3 command below:
```
pip3 install PyPDF2
pip3 install pypttsx3
```
### Steps to run the file ###
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Maneesha24/Designing-a-PDF-Audiobook.git
$ jupyter notebook
```
